Famous Foods: From Babi Guling, Satay Babi, to Ayam Betutu, Bali has a very rich culinary culture. There are lots of great food to explore in Bali, but one that I cannot miss when visiting Bali is the roast pork from Warung Babi Guling Pande Egi. You should try it out when visiting Bali!

Famous Places: If you love climbing mountains, Gunung Agung and Mount Batur are the places to go. It offers spectacular views of the island and you can also enjoy the sunrise. Nungnung Waterfall is also the perfect place for you to feel closer to nature and refresh yourself.

When you visit Sumba, don't miss the chance to explore Kampung Tarung, where you can observe the locals' way of life and learn about their traditional customs. Additionally, I would highly recommend trying Manggulu, a traditional cake made from bananas, brown sugar, and peanuts. It's a delicious and unique delicacy that you won't want to miss!
